## Fetching Season Pass Progression

### You'll need
- [DestinySeasonPassDefinition](https://bungie-net.github.io/multi/schema_Destiny-Definitions-Seasons-DestinySeasonPassDefinition.html#schema_Destiny-Definitions-Seasons-DestinySeasonPassDefinition)
- [DestinySeasonDefinition](https://bungie-net.github.io/multi/schema_Destiny-Definitions-Seasons-DestinySeasonDefinition.html#schema_Destiny-Definitions-Seasons-DestinySeasonDefinition)

## How-To
You can fetch all character progression data from the `GetProfile` endpoint with the `104` component present in the request URL:<br>
`https://www.bungie.net/Platform/Destiny2/${membershipType}/Profile/${destinyMembershipId}/?components=104,202`

Once you have the response you are able to see all of the progressions that are global to the entire profile, as opposed to a specified character. This is because we also used component `202`. You can remove this component if you do not need to access this data.

From the initial response you can find progression data, concatenating a `characterId` like this:<br>
`.data.Response.characterProgressions.data[characterId].progressions`

You should now be able to access something like this:

This is an object that contains `key:values` for all progressions, present on the specified character (using `characterId`).

Each key represents a progression hash and the value contains the progression data.

## Getting the current season

We have a characters progressional data but now we have to fetch the progression hash for the current season, and use the manifest/definitions to "translate" it.

You are easily able to get the current season hash from the same `GetProfile` response object.
`.data.Response.profile.data.currentSeasonHash`

We then need to use DestinySeasonDefinitions to get the current season pass `seasonPassProgressionHash`, by doing this:
`DestinySeasonDefinitions[currentSeasonHash].seasonPassProgressionHash`

## Putting it all together

### We have

- Character progressions
- seasonPassProgressionHash

Index our character progressions using the seasonPassProgressionHash. That should return something like this:

**Note:** *If a user is over level 100 on the season pass, this progression will no longer be touched. This means that the player has now "prestiged". Progression data for season pass levels now exists in its prestige progression counterpart.*

### Prestige progressions

When a user exceeds level 100, the above season progression is no longer used.

To get the prestige progression, we first have to get the `seasonPassHash`; `seasonPassDefinitions` combined with `seasonDefinitions`.

We can get the `seasonPassHash` by doing the following:<br>
`seasonPassInfo = seasonPassDefinitions[seasonDefinitions[CurrentSeasonHash].seasonPassHash]`

You should then be able to index character progressions again by doing the following:<br>
`CharacterProgressions[seasonPassInfo.prestigeProgressionHash]`

**Note:** *This will return an object, the same as the one in the screenshot above, however it represents every level gained AFTER level 100. For example if you are level 105, it will display level 5 in the prestige progression and level 100 in the other.*
